&ensp;&ensp;I am a bioinformatician by profession working at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. During my PhD research at SDSU, I realized the enormity of sequencing data and the potential knowledge that could be mined from the publicly available databases like Genebank and Uniprot. This ignited my interest into the bioinformatics and eventually I completed master’s in data science to get the firm grasp of cutting-edge techniques in bigdata management and machine learning. I have an extensive experience working with genomic data, phylogenetic analysis, gene expression data and other omics. R and python are my favorite computer languages and I like learning and teaching new statistical methods specialized for the study of multiple -omics data in biology. 

### Area of expertise  
&ensp;&ensp;Data science being an inter-disciplinary subject needs expertise in range of fields. I would like to delineate  my area of interest and expertise burrowing the concept of data science venn diagram by [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram).
