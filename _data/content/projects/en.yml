      project_excerpt: "The impressive and complicated models frequently showcased as triumph of cutting edge advancement in AI and computer science on the heart relies on the principles and theorems developed in statistics and mathematics. Therefore one of my top priority projects is to have clear idea on concepts like sampling distribution, hypothesis testing, analysis of variance and experimental design."

       # Statistics
       ![Troy Data Science meme](:Stat2.jpg){:data-align="center"}

       &ensp;&ensp;Statistics is a fascinating discipline  to study and as you start to understand the essence of techniques used in statistics and develop some intuitive thinking about data and probability, it becomes quite engaging and rewarding as well. Having its origin deeply rooted in the field of mathematics and probability theory, its becomes quite intimidating for anybody from non-mathematics background to dive deep into the theories used in statistics. The general tendency among learners with non-mathematics background is to skip any apparently complex topic as unnecessary mathematical detail. By doing so one may learn to use the statistical tools but when its time to interpret the results or when one needs to design their own experiment from scratch, its hard to do so because of lack of crystal clear understanding of statics. I struggled myself with this a lot during my undergraduate and early gradate years. It is really hard to know how deep one needs to go, so that you can grasp the clear idea about statistics but you do not need dig back your notes on algebra and calculus from highschool classes.

       &ensp;&ensp;One of the struggles I had while learning statistic was to build intuitive thinking about fundamental concepts of statistics like population, sample, population parameters and sample statistics. This is where I developed my own method of learning statistics which is, **learn by experimenting**. It is really hard to build intuition just by seeing one or two datasets presented in a textbook. Being a student of science, I couldn't swallow every formula without completely understanding it. I wanted to experiment every statement and theories discussed in a textbook. The best tool I found to do so is **R**, which is basically a metaverse for statistics. Every theories in statistics can be tested in R by generating some dummy data. It has support for any type of distribution and we can simulate any kind of sample. Doing so helped me skip theoretical proof of theorems in statistics, but still get clear picture of what the equation is doing. I do not know how to prove central limit theorem mathematically, but I can generate thousands of samples in R and see the distribution of sample means and variance which will be very close to the one given by the theorems.  This approach helped me a lot to learn both statistics and R. So, I want to share my notes with everyone who wants to learn statistics with minimum mathematics. All my notes on category of `Statistics` are my attempts to explain each topics with as much experiment as possible. 

        1. Principle of inference.
        2. Mean and Variance 
        3. Permutation and combination 
        4. Probability theory
        5. Statistical distribution        
         5.1 Binomial distribution      
         5.2 Normal Distribution (t-distribution, $$\chi^2$$, F- distribution)
        6. Hypothesis testing 
        7. ANOVA (One-way and Factorial)
        8. Regression (Simple, multiple)
        9. Degree of freedom

      #&ensp;&ensp;Variation is a double sided sword. The world is beautiful and exciting because it is full of variations, not a single flower growing even on a same plant is exactly same as other. Nor any two human beings in this world filled with 7.7 billion are exactly same. This variation fills life with excitement and adventure because you can expect to see and enjoy new experience every new place you go, and every new day. But when you are attempting to study a population, variance becomes a curse. Imagine a world without any variation. It would be much easier to say, take one man, do some test and treatment on him and that result would apply to all other man in the world. In such an world there would be no need of statistics. Life would be much easier as a researcher. But we need to face the reality and accept that variance exist and need to use statistical principles to study a population.  
      #&ensp;&ensp;On top of variance, a researcher road is complicated by the fact that population we need to study is usually huge and we almost never have enough resource and capacity to study every single individual within that population. So, we need to make inference based on a subset of population, called sample. All my notes on category of `Statistics` are my attempts to understand the principles of statistics that are applied in data science and bioinformatics.

        Data visualization can be done by using multiple tools like excel, ggplot, js or other. GGplot is one of the most flexible and powerful tool.
